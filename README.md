## 📌 Project Highlights (short)
### Automated Seaweed Growth Analysis
- Satellite imagery segmentation pipeline to detect and quantify seaweed growth across seasonal snapshots. Includes pre-processing with Google Earth Engine, model training (U-Net style CNN), and visual output overlays for monitoring. *(Demo GIF placeholder below — replace with `assets/seaweed_demo.gif`)*

### Energy Forecasting Using Traffic Insights
- Combined traffic counts and weather/time signals to forecast short-term energy demand using RNNs and ensemble methods. Achieved strong validation performance and clear operational value for load planning.

### Chatbot / Prompt Engineering & NLP
- Fine-tuning and prompt experiments to improve intent classification, slot-filling, and conversational flow. Reproducible notebooks with evaluation metrics and sample queries.
